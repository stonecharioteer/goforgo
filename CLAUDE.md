- ‚úÖ **Automated Validation**: `scripts/check_exercises.sh` for ongoing exercise integrity verification
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Counting**: Single source of truth for exercise counts across all commands
- ‚úÖ **Consistent User Experience**: All commands show identical counts, no discrepancies

- ‚úÖ **Phase 5 Third-Party Libraries**: Complete integration with 12 major Go libraries and frameworks

### Implementation Memories

#### Development Environment & Workflow

- **Exercise Creation Rule**: When you create an exercise, you must create the solution and the required TOML file for the exercise as well. The exercise is incomplete without all three components.
- **Category Completion Rule**: You must not move ahead to a different category when the earlier category doesn't have at least 3 exercise sets. A set is comprised of the exercise, the solution and the TOML file.
- **Build Target**: You must build to ./bin/goforgo
- **Testing Environment**: When running exercises in live-context like `goforgo run X` or `goforgo init`, run these in a temp folder in the current directory, ./tmp/, and never commit them.
- **Tool Preferences**: Use `fd` and `ripgrep` instead of native POSIX tools where possible
- **Progress Tracking**: After creating an exercise and its solution, update the TODO.md file with the path to the exercise for automatic progress recording.
- **Exercise Validation**: Run `./scripts/check_exercises.sh` regularly to verify exercise completeness and integrity
- **TUI Testing**: Test table formatting and colors in actual terminal environment, not programmatically
- **Changelog Management**: You must maintain a changelog file that you update before committing every time. Use full timestamps.
- **Real-World Focus**: Categories now emphasize practical Go usage with microservices, databases, and gRPC patterns
- **Production Patterns**: Exercises include circuit breakers, distributed tracing, connection pooling, and streaming protocols
- **Commit Message Guidelines**:
