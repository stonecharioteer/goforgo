# GoForGo Development Insights & Learnings

_Notes and insights from building GoForGo - an interactive Go tutorial CLI inspired by Rustlings_

## üéØ Current Status (Updated: 2025-08-06)

**Major Achievement**: GoForGo now has **153 complete exercise sets** with professional TUI, full automation support, comprehensive real-world coverage, and **Phase 5 third-party library integration**!

### Recent Accomplishments
- ‚úÖ **Professional TUI Interface**: Replaced manual formatting with lipgloss table widget for perfect alignment
- ‚úÖ **Rich Visual Experience**: Column-specific colors (difficulty by level, status by completion, category coding)
- ‚úÖ **Shell Automation**: CLI `--oneline` flag for pipe-friendly output and script integration
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Column Sizing**: Consistent table widths based on all exercises with 10% padding
- ‚úÖ **Exercise Validation System**: Every exercise has complete triplets (exercise, solution, TOML) - 100% verified
- ‚úÖ **Automated Validation**: `scripts/check_exercises.sh` for ongoing exercise integrity verification
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Counting**: Single source of truth for exercise counts across all commands
- ‚úÖ **Consistent User Experience**: All commands show identical counts, no discrepancies
- ‚úÖ **Real-World Coverage**: Added comprehensive microservices, databases, and gRPC categories
- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready Content**: All 37 categories with minimum 3 exercise sets each
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5 Third-Party Libraries**: Added gorilla/mux, cobra CLI, and Bubble Tea TUI integration

### Implementation Memories

#### Development Environment & Workflow

- **Exercise Creation Rule**: When you create an exercise, you must create the solution and the required TOML file for the exercise as well. The exercise is incomplete without all three components.
- **Category Completion Rule**: You must not move ahead to a different category when the earlier category doesn't have at least 3 exercise sets. A set is comprised of the exercise, the solution and the TOML file.
- **Build Target**: You must build to ./bin/goforgo
- **Testing Environment**: When running exercises in live-context like `goforgo run X` or `goforgo init`, run these in a temp folder in the current directory, ./tmp/, and never commit them.
- **Tool Preferences**: Use `fd` and `ripgrep` instead of native POSIX tools where possible
- **Progress Tracking**: After creating an exercise and its solution, update the TODO.md file with the path to the exercise for automatic progress recording.
- **Exercise Validation**: Run `./scripts/check_exercises.sh` regularly to verify exercise completeness and integrity
- **TUI Testing**: Test table formatting and colors in actual terminal environment, not programmatically
- **Changelog Management**: You must maintain a changelog file that you update before committing every time. Use full timestamps.
- **Real-World Focus**: Categories now emphasize practical Go usage with microservices, databases, and gRPC patterns
- **Production Patterns**: Exercises include circuit breakers, distributed tracing, connection pooling, and streaming protocols
- **Commit Message Guidelines**:

- **DatabaseValidator**: Runs queries, checks schemas, validates transactions
- **ProcessValidator**: Monitors processes, goroutines, resource usage
- **NetworkValidator**: Tests TCP/UDP servers, client connections
- **ConcurrencyValidator**: Detects race conditions, validates thread safety
- **MetricsValidator**: Checks Prometheus metrics, custom counters
- **LogValidator**: Validates structured logs, error patterns

**‚öôÔ∏è Enhanced TOML Configuration:**
- Extended validation section with services and rules specifications
- Backward compatible with legacy validation modes (build, test, run, static)
- Complex service dependencies and composite validation rules
- Production-ready examples in 4+ real exercises

**üîÑ Integration & Compatibility:**
- Updated CLI commands to use UniversalRunner automatically
- Seamless detection between universal and legacy validation modes
- Comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup
- Professional logging and progress reporting

**üìä Updated Real Exercises:**
- **16_http/http_server**: HTTP route validation with endpoint testing
- **33_databases/sql_basics**: PostgreSQL service + comprehensive database validation  
- **32_microservices/circuit_breaker**: Mock services + concurrency + metrics testing
- **11_concurrency/worker_pools**: Goroutine monitoring + structured log validation

**üß™ Testing & Validation:**
- Comprehensive test suite covering all validation components
- Container integration tests for PostgreSQL services
- UniversalRunner integration tests with both legacy and universal modes
- Build verification and deployment testing confirmed

**üéØ Production Deployment:**
- System successfully tested with real exercises
- Resource cleanup verified working perfectly
- Backward compatibility confirmed with existing 146 exercises
- Performance optimized for production workloads
