```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stonecharioteer/goforgo.git
cd goforgo

# Build and install
just build  # or: go build -o bin/goforgo ./cmd/goforgo

# Initialize exercises in your learning directory
mkdir ~/learn-go && cd ~/learn-go

```bash
go install github.com/stonecharioteer/goforgo/cmd/goforgo@latest
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Initialize Your Learning Environment

```bash
goforgo init
```

This creates:

- `exercises/` - 182+ Go exercises organized by topic
